This project contains an automated test suite that simulates a typical user shopping experience on Amazon. The tests cover:

Searching for a product

Adding the product to the basket

Updating the item quantity

The project is implemented in Python using Pytest and Playwright, following the Page Object Model (POM) for clean, modular, and maintainable code. This structure allows easy extension to add more test scenarios or websites in the future.
